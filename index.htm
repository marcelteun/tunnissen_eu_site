  Hi,

<center><h1>
    Introduction to Marcelteun
</h1></center>
<p/><b>
  Welcome to the home page of Marcel T&uuml;nnissen or
  marcelteun which is a login name that I use a lot on the internet.
  The topic here is
  <a href="polyh/index.htm">my polyhedron models</a>,
  but I would like to start by introducing myself.
</b><p/><b>
  Originally I come from Holland, but on September 4<sup>th</sup> 2000 I
  moved to Sweden, where I have been living since then.
  My nickname in Holland used to be Teun, but for a non-native Swedish speaker
  that sounds a bit as the Swedish word "t&ouml;nt", meaning retard, though native
  speakers would think the nickname incomprehensible.
  Anyway you understand that I haven't been using my nickname so much anymore
  since I moved to Sweden and people know me as Marcel nowadays.
</b><p/><b>
  I'm married and I have two grown-up sons and in my spare time I like to program, build polyhedron models,
  walk in nature, climb mountains, look for geocaches, play table tennis, etc.
  With table tennis I started late in live, which means I am not that good, but I think it is a lot of fun.
</b><p/><b>
  I could share many things about my hobbies here, but I am just sharing anything related to polyhedra;
  both interactive models that you can explore here and paper models that I built myself.
  A collection of pictures can also be found on
<!--
  Perhaps I should move this to polyh/index.htm

  TODO: Say something about the background pattern?

</b><p/><b>
  Reactions, remarks, feed back, all are welcome. Just send me an email.
  Use my official first name and
  add that to the domain name, with the 'at' sign of course.
  That is all about me for now, so check out
