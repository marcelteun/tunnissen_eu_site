This is the first puzzle I designed. Actually I ly a little bit, because I changed the design twice; I was not satisfied with the others. At first my
goal was to show the relation between the rhombic (with golden ratio)
dodecahedron and the rhombic triacontahedron, but I think I did not
succeed, though I am very satisfied with the result. I need the black ropes to take the different pieces apart.

The pieces of this puzzle all have the same 
<A name="pieces" href="6x5Piecs.htm">shape</A>, and it is not such a difficult
puzzle to <A name="whole" href="6x5Whole.htm">solve</A>, though there is a
little trick to it. I also took a picture of intermediate stages: 
<A name="3pieces" href="6x5Half.htm">3 pieces</A>, and 
<A name="5pieces" href="6x5Open3.htm">5 pieces</A>.
