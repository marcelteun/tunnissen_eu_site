<p><b>
Here is another uniform compound of uniform polyhedra.
This is a compound of four octahedra and the whole compound has the same
symmetry as one Octahedron (<i>S<sub>4</sub>xI</i>).
There is only one possibilty to do this.
The whole model can be fit into a cube, but the picture was taken in such a way
that this isn't too obvious. You can easily see this when playing around with
the interactive 3D model on the right.

<p><b>
This is a model that is easy to build and you will only need to cut and paste
144 pieces. With the material I use, it isn't that easy to get all the edges
straight and you can see in the picture that I didn't do a very good job
everywhere, e.g. with the black edges at the top. The blue and the orange edges
below and parallel to those black edges are a bit better though.
I finished this model at the end of January 2019.

<p><b>
The whole model is rigid and reminds me a bit of a crystal. For this reason I
was thinking of building this in one colour only, but in the end I used colours
that clearly distinguishes the four octahedra.
