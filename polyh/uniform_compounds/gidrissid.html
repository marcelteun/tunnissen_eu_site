This model is actual a compound of two Great Inverted Retrosnub
Icosidodecahedra. It isn't my habit to build big complex models, but when I
heard that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Wenninger">Fr. Magnus Wenninger</a>
had passed away on February 17, 2017, slowly the
idea of building one complex model as a tribute to him.
</b></p>

<p><b>
The first book I ever bought about polyhedron models was
Magnus Wenninger's book "Polyhedron Models".
In the end of the book were some models that were absolutely stunning. I
couldn't comprehend how it was possible that someone could build that.
I thought it would be fitting to try to build one of these models: the
the Great Inverted Retrosnub Icosidodecahedron.
But then my eye fell on the compound of two of these.
Apparently it had only be built twice before:

and

by
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/home.htm">Jonathan Bowers</a>.
</b></p>

<p><b>
First I started preparing templates. Usually I draw these by hand, but since I
needed to cut and paste 2580 parts, I prepared a PDF file with pieces "close" to
each other so that I could print these out directly on Chromolux, the cardboard
that I use.  The pieces are glued together by tabs, but for the tabs I used
paper. This means that I cut out some cardboard pieces first, then I glue them
on paper together, then I cut these out leaving some paper tabs (which means
t at I cut out everything twice).
The PDF file also contains some pages that need to be printed on the paper that
is used to glue the cardboard pieces on.
</b></p>

<p><b>
With the templates done I started building on March 28th and the model was
ready February 17, 2018. Coincidently this was one year after Magnus Wenninger
died (which I only realised weeks later). It took me around 225 hours to build.
I took the time from building one twelfth. Multiplying gave 221.8 hours, but it
is more, since I had to fix some mistakes sometimes: I had used the wrong colour
of green and I had to exchange the pieces. Actually there is a mistake is one of
the smallest pieces. It has the wrong colour of blue, but it is almost
impossible to see, even for me.
