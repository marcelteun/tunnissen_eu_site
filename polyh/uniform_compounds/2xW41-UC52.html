This compound has the same symmetry a cube and you can see a cross in the order four symmetry axis. At the same time you can recognise pentagrams and equilateral triangles. The diameter of the model is around 13 cm (~5.1 inches)

This wasn't my first try of this model. I started building in June 2018 , but
noticed that it didn't work well and I decided to start over in August to make
corrections for the thickness of the material. The model was finished in
November 2018.
