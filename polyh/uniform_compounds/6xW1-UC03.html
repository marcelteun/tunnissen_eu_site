<p><b>
Here is another uniform compound of uniform polyhedra.
After completing a big model that took me almost a year I wanted to build a
small model.
I like smaller models better than the big ones. They are easier to store and
take with you and they are more sturdy.

<p><b>
In the completed model each colour is the classical Stella Octangula consisting
of two tetrahedra.
A Stella Octangula can be contained exactly in a cube and this model is directly related to the classical compound of three cubes.
</b></p>

<p><b>
The model isn't very complex and it took me only one week to build.
I finished it in the late spring of 2018
