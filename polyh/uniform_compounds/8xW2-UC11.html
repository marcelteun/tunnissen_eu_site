<p><b>
Here is another uniform compound of uniform polyhedra.
This is a compound of eight Octahedra and the whole compound has the same
symmetry as an octahedron (<i>S<sub>4</sub>xI</i>).
Many of these exists. You just place an octahedron in such a way it shares an
order three axis with the final symmetry and then you apply the symmetries that
are needed to obtain the final symmetry.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This position is special because a subcompound obtains a higher symmetry:
<i>A<sub>4</sub>xI</i>. This is emphasised by using two colours. Each
sub-compound is a compound of four cubes with <i>A<sub>4</sub>xI</i> symmetry.
Since this is a uniform compound, such a sub-compound is uniform too.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This model is quite easy to build. The way I built it you will need to cut and
paste 216 pieces. You could however decide to use 4 colours and give the
octahedra that share an order 3 axis the same colour. In that case you would
only need to cut and paste 144 pieces. The 3D model on the right contains some
flickering faces. The way I solved that in the paper model is the reason for
this difference.
