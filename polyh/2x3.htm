This puzzle is designed by the Dutch artist named Rinus Roelofs, who has a
version that consists of two different kinds of metal. See 
<a href="http://www.rinusroelofs.nl/">http://www.rinusroelofs.nl/</a> for his
website. I made the one shown here out of cardboard. If you put the two pieces
together you will get <a name="whole" href="2x3Whole.htm">this cube</a>.
If you have a VRML viewer installed you can investigate one piece
<a href="./wrl/cubepuzzle2.wrl">here</a>.
In this model faces with the same shape have the same colour.

The puzzle is not difficult to solve, and it looks as if it is simple to reproduce one yourself.
This is however more difficult than it appears, and that is also the main reason why I like this so much: it is simple and still complicated.
