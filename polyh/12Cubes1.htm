I guess it was somewhere around 1995 that I derived this model from the
Trapezoidal Icositretrahedron, which is the dual of a Rhombicubocatahedron. 
I calculated the model by hand, including the pieces I needed to build
a model of it.
I built two models. I was not so satisfied with the material I used for the
first one, so I built this one afterwards. The first one I gave away.

The whole model is a compound of 12 cubes with cube symmetry. I used four
colours to indicate that the model consists of four of the same compounds of
3 cubes. It is a special form of
12<I>B</I>|<I>S</I><SUB>4</SUB>x<I>I|C</I><SUB>2</SUB>x<I>I</I>, where the
model consists of 4x3|<I>D</I><SUB>12</SUB> as described in H.F.Verheyen's
Symmetry Orbits.
