This model was built in 2014 and its dimensions is around 6.5 cm x 6.5 cm x 6.5 cm.

<p><b>
This polyhedron only consists of regular heptagons that are folded over a
diagonal. There are different ways in which you can fold a regular heptagon and
for this polyhedron the folding is done in a 'W' shape.
</b></p>

<p><b>
he polyhedron only has the rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron, i.e. it
doesn't have any reflections. I like these kind of symmetries that only have
rotational symmetries, and they are often a bit more challenging to build,
though this one is quite easy to build.
The main reason being that there are no intersections, which also means that you
can make a model of this if you can draw a regular heptagon.

<p><b>
The resulting model is quite nice, even though it isn't very rigid. It looks a
bit like a 3D puzzle piece.
