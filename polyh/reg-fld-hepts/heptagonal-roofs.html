This model was built in 2011 and its dimensions is around 11 cm x 11 cm x 11 cm.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This polyhedron only consists of regular heptagons that are folded over a
diagonal. There are different ways in which you can fold a regular heptagon and
for this polyhedron the folding is done in a 'W' shape.
</b></p>

<p><b>
he polyhedron has the same rotational symmetry as a tetrahedraon, however a central inversion is included to the symmetry group (which a tetrahedron doesn't have).
This model is really easy to build and since it doesn't have any intersections,
one only need to be able to draw a heptagon to build it.
</b></p>

<p><b>
For most of the polyhedra I didn't really proof that the heptagons are really regular. For this one I did put together a proof that there should be a solution for a regular heptagon. This means that I didn't proof it by a direct algebraic calculation. Instead I showed that for heptagons this kind of polyhedron can be obtained and that there is no singularity for the regular heptagon.

<p><b>
The interesting thing is that this one is closely related to
<a href="./h3.html">H<sup>3</sup></a>  which has a 'shell' fold instead of a 'W'
fold.
H<sup>3</sup> consists of pyramids roofs with a pentagonal base.
Such a pentagonal base is shown in the figure below.
