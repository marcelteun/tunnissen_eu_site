This model was built in Januari 2020 and its dimensions is around 8.5 cm x 8.5 cm x
8.5cm.

This polyhedron only consists of regular heptagons that are folded over a
diagonal and for this polyhedron the folding is done in a 'W' shape:

The polyhedron has the same rotational symmetry as a cube, i.e. without
the reflections. I like these kind of symmetries where the reflections are
missing. I found <a href="nemesis.html">Nemesis</a> first, then I understood
that the heptagons were organised in triplets around a star with three
points.
Later I found and built
<a href="tetrahedral-trinjastar.html">tetrahedral</a> and
<a href="octahedral-trinjastar.html">cube</a> variants as well.
I also suspected that it would be possible to arrange the heptagons in stars of
four instead of stars of three and indeed I could lead my numerical search
program to such a solution.
