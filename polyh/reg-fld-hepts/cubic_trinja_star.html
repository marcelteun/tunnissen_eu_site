This model was built in December 2019 and its dimensions is around 8.5 cm x 8.5 cm x
8.5cm.

This polyhedron only consists of regular heptagons that are folded over a

for this polyhedron the folding is done in a 'W' shape:

The polyhedron has the same rotational symmetry as a cube, i.e. without
the reflections. I like these kind of symmetries where the reflections are
missing. I found <a href="nemesis.html">Nemesis</a> first, then I understood
that the heptagons were organised in triplets around a star with three
points. I thought that this variant might exist with
<a href="tetrahedral-trinjastar.html">tetrahedral</a> and cube
symmetry as well. Then I led a search program towards this both solutions.

<p><b>
Polyhedra that lack reflections are usually a bit more challenging to build and
Nemesis was no exception. Since I found the right build strategy for that one
before, it was not a problem building this one using the same strategy.
As for the tetrahedral version I expected two variants here. I did find another
variant, but not the one expected. I will probably build the other variant some
time in the future.
