This model was built in 2012 and its dimensions is around 9.5 cm x 9.5 cm x 9.5 cm.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This polyhedron only consists of regular heptagons that are folded over a
diagonal. There are different ways in which you can fold a regular heptagon and
for this polyhedron the folding is done in a 'shell' shape.
</b></p>

<p><b>
he polyhedron only has the rotational symmetries of a cube, i.e. it doesn't have
any reflections. I like these kind of symmetries that only have rotational
symmetries, and they are often a bit more challenging to build.
I decided to build this model, since there are some intersections, but not so
many that is becomes chaotic, as is the case for many polyhedra with folded
regular heptagons that I found.

<p><b>
A little bit about the name:
This polyhedron has some sharp points that should end up close to eachother
without touching. You will always get some imprecision and small deviations
become noticable easily when these small distances vary a bit: either the
distance becomes twice as big or the vertices suddenly touch.
Besides that the model was on display at the Bridges Conference in 2013 and it
is always good to have a sign that says that you shouldn't touch my paper
models.

Note for the model in the 3D player on the right the colours are divided
in a slightly different way than for the paper model.
