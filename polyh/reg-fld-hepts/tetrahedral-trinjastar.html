This model was built in October 2019 and its dimensions is around 7 cm x 7 cm x
7cm.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This polyhedron only consists of regular heptagons that are folded over a
diagonal. There are different ways in which you can fold a regular heptagon and
for this polyhedron the folding is done in a 'W' shape.
</b></p>

<p><b>
The polyhedron has the same rotational symmetry as a tetrahedron, i.e. without
the reflections. I like these kind of symmetries where the reflections are
missing. I found <a href="nemesis.html">Nemesis</a> first, then I understood
that the heptagons were organised in triplets around a star with three
points. I thought that this variant might exist with tetrahedral and octahedron
symmetry as well. Then I led a search program towards this one.
</b></p>

<p><b>
Polyhedra that lack reflections are usually a bit more challenging to build and
Nemesis was no exception. Since I found the right build strategy for that one
before, it was not a problem building this one using the same strategy.
The search program found two variants of this one. In the interactive 3D model
you can choose which one to look at.

Here is the same model while more or less looking into an order two symmetry axis.
