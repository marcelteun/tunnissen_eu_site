I don't remember when I built this one. The design for this model is easy. I
just took the compound of 12 cubes as shown <A HREF="./12Cubes1.htm">here</A>
and added one cube according to the symmetry. Easier said or thought than
done. After that I needed to caculate and to start building again. That
takes several months alltogether (I don't remember how much exactly). Anyway
I was very satisfied with the result.
