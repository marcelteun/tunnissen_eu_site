I don't remember when I built this one exactly, but it was some time during the
90s. The design for this model is easy. I
just took the compound of 12 cubes as shown <A HREF="./12Cubes1.htm">here</A>
and added one cube according to the symmetry. Easier said or thought than
done. At that time I had to calculate pieces algebraically by hand. And building
the models takes time too.
All that took several months alltogether (I don't remember how much exactly).
Anyway I was very satisfied with the result. Even though the model isn't that
special.
