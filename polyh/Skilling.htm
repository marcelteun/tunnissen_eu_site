I came up with this idea somewhere in 1999. Later on I found out that that J. Skilling of Cambridge, England, already found this model in 1975. 
It has a rotation freedom, though this one has a stable sub-compound.

It is possible to add one cube. However, it is more beautiful to take another rotation within the rotational freedom, to get a stable sub-compound again.
