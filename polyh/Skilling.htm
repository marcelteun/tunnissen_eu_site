I came up with this idea somewhere in 1999. Later on I found out that that J.
Skilling of Cambridge, England, already found this model in 1975.  It has a
rotation freedom, though this one has a stable sub-compound, which means that
a sub-compound of 2 cubes (having one colour in the picture) has a higher
symmetry.

<p><b>
It is possible to add one cube, in a similar way as for
<a href="ClassiC.htm">the classic compound of three cubes</a>.
However, it is more beautiful to take
another rotation within the
rotational freedom, to get a stable sub-compound again.
