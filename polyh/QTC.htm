Is started this model after break of not building, just to get the feeling
back again. I decided to use a bit of a different colour arrangement. Instead
of colouring the octagrams with one colour they got three colours. The
reason for this was that I wanted to accentuate the crowns, while using the
Swedish national colours. Using black and white for the triangles, I wanted
to put these a bit apart. The red I used to give the whole model
a warm centre.

If you want to make this one as well you can write out this 
<A HREF="templates/QTC.pdf">PDF file</A> which I prepared. You can use it as
a template. You will only need the coloured parts.
