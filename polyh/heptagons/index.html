      <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>Polyhedra with regular 7-gons, i.e.
        heptagons, are special. It is difficult to find any polyhedra containing
        regular heptagons without allowing the other faces to become "too exotic", not
        taking into account cyclic or dihedral polyhedra with a 7-fold (principal)
        rotation axis. For instance none of the Johnson Solids have heptagons.
        I guess this has to do with the fact that other symmetries do not have a 7-fold
        axis and that 7 is prime.
        <a href="../reghepts/index.html">Here</a> some polyhedra with regular heptagons can be found.
        
      </p>
      <p>I guess that is why heptagons are a bit pushed out of
        attention, which that makes them even more fascinating I think and this is why
        I started to look for equilateral polyhedra that contain heptagons and that
        have a symmetry based on the tetrahedron, octahedron or icosahedron. On
        this page some results are showed.

      <h2><a name="polyh">Models</a></h2>
      <img src="pics/hepta.A4xI.O2.jpg" align="top" border=0/>
      <p>The image shown above shows a polyhedron consisting of 12
        equilateral heptagons and 16 equilateral triangles only. This means that the
        total amount of faces equals to 28, which is dividable by 7. I tried to emphasise
        this by using 4 colours, i.e. every colour is divided over 7 faces in a regular
        way. This means that this polyhedron has a stellation that is a compound of 4
        (of the same) polyhedra that consist of 7 faces. This compound belongs to the
        same symmetry group and the constituents have C3 symmetry.
        It is difficult to get an overview of the polyhedron from just the
        picture. 
        <a href="vrml/hepta.A4xI.wrl">This VRML file</a> gives a better understanding.
        
      </p>
      <img src="pics/hepta.S4xI.O4.jpg" align="top" border=0/>
      <p>The above model has the same symmetry as a cube. It consists of
        24 equilateral heptagons, 6 squares and 12 rhombs. As the previous one the
        total number of faces (42) is dividable by 7. The model in the image doesn't
        emphasise this, since I didn't think this would lead to an interesting colour
        arrangement . Instead I used a 5 colour arrangement, where all the rhombs get
        one colour and the remaining colours are divided equally over the rest of the
        faces. The image shows the model looking into a 4-fold axis, 
        <a href="pics/hepta.S4xI.O2.jpg">this image</a> shows the model
        in a 2-fold axis and 
        <a href="pics/hepta.S4xI.O3.jpg">this image</a> in a 3-fold axis.
        
      </p>
      <img src="pics/hepta.A5xI.O2.jpg" align="top" border=0/>
      <p>The above model is similar to the previous one, except that it
        has the same symmetry as a dodecahedron. It consists of 60 equilateral
        heptagons, 12 regular pentagons and 30 rhombs.
        Unlike the previous polyhedra the total number of faces (102) is not dividable
        by 7, but the model in the image does use a 7 colour arragement.
        All rhombs and pentagons use one colour and the heptagons use the remaining 6
        colours in such a way that 6 one-coloured rings of 10 heptagons are obtained.
        Each ring has its own 5-fold axis from the symmetry of the polyhedron.
        The image shows the model looking into a 2-fold axis, so that one can see that
        the rhombs look almost like squares.
        
        <a href="pics/hepta.A5xI.O3.jpg">this image</a> shows the model (more or less) in a 3-fold axis and 
        <a href="pics/hepta.A5xI.O5.jpg">this image</a> (more or less) in a
        5-fold axis.
        Hier is the model in moving action:
      </p>
      <p>
        <object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/ake2FbB74r0&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/ake2FbB74r0&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object>
      </p>
      <img src="pics/hepta.GD.A5xI.jpg" align="top" border=0/>
      <p>Even though the above model is not convex it is pretty
        similar to the first model. It has the same relationship with the Great
        Dodecahedron as the first model has with the Tetrahedron.
        It consists of 60 equilateral heptagons, 12 regular pentagons and 60
        equilateral triangles.
        All pentagons are hidden inside the model and that is what made me decide to
        make the model with a transparent material.
        It is remarkable that the heptagons almost look like regular heptagons.
        After rounding the angles equal to: 129.89, 132.88, 125.54, 125.54, 132.88,
        129.89, 123.39 degrees.
        
      </p>
      <p>The image does not really give a good impression of the model
        itself; it is especially hard to see the complete heptagons.
        The best way to investigate it is by rolling it in your hand, so that heptagons can be recognised.
        For this reason I put a short film on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
        <object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/GMp7ZUgSpSo&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/GMp7ZUgSpSo&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object>
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is still not very satisfying, but it gives a least a better impression.
        Another way to investigate the polyhedron is by playing 
        <a href="vrml/hepta.GD.A5xI.wrl">this VRML file</a>.
        The model was built in three stages. 
        
        <a href="pics/hepta.GD.A5xI.phase1.jpg">This image</a> shows the first stage, the second stage can be seen 
        <a href="pics/hepta.GD.A5xI.phase2.jpg">here</a> and the above image shows the final stage.
        
      </p>
      <img src="pics/hepta.GD.A5xI.x3.jpg" align="top" border=0/>
      <p>The mode above is topologically equivalent to the previous one and it
      can be derived tilting the heptagons, while keeping the pentagons and
      triangles regular. The heptagons are tilted in such a way that the
      pentagons end up on the outside. As a result the dihedral angle between
      two neighbouring triangles becomes less than 180 degrees, while it was
      more than 180 degrees in the previous one.
