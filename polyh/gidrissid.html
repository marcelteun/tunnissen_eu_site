This model is actual a compound of two Great Inverted Retrosnub
Icosidodecahedra. It isn't my habit to build big complex models, but when I
heard that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Wenninger">Fr. Magnus Wenninger</a>
had passed away on February 17, 2017, slowly the
idea of building one complex model as a tribute to him.
</b></p>

<p><b>
The first book I ever bought about polyhedron models was
Magnus Wenninger's book "Polyhedron Models".
In the end of the book were some models that were absolutely stunning. I
couldn't comprehend how it was possible that someone could build that.
I thought it would be fitting to try to build one of these models: the
the Great Inverted Retrosnub Icosidodecahedron.
But then my eye fell on the compound of two of these.
Apparently it had only be built twice before:

and

by
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.polytope.net/hedrondude/home.htm">Jonathan Bowers</a>.
</b></p>

<p><b>
First I started preparing templates. Usually I draw these by hand, but since I
needed to cut and paste 2580 parts, prepared a PDF file with pieces "close" to
each other and so that I could print these out on Chromolux, the cardboard that I use.
The pieces are glued together by tabs, be for the tabs I used paper. This means
that I cut out the cardboard pieces first, then I glue them on paper together,
then I cut these out leaving some paper tabs (which means that I cut out everything
twice).
The PDF file also contains some pages that need to be printed on the paper that
is used to glue the cardboard pieces on.
</b></p>

<p><b>
With the templates done I started building at the end of March and the model was
ready February 17, 2018. Coincidently this was one year after Magnus Wenninger
died (which I only realised weeks later).
