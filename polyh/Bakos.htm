This polyhedron model of the beautiful Bakos compound consists of 4 cubes and
the whole compound has the symmetry of one cube. It was published by T.Bakos in
1959. What I like about the model that all faces of the cubes are alike and the
whole model consists of three different pieces only. A template for building
this model can be found <A HREF="templates/Bakos.pdf">here</A>.

For the people that wonder what the thing on the background is: it is a
music-cd from Kelly Joe Phelps called: "Sky Like a Broken Clock".

I found a way to put three Bakos compound into a compound of 12 cubes. 
A model of that polyhedron can be found
