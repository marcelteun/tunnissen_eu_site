<p><b>
This is a compound of twelve tetrahedra which has the same symmetry as a cube.
Each tetrahedron shares one 2-fold axis with a 2-fold axis of the compound.
It is a rigid compound, which means there is no other compound of twelve
tetrahedra with this symmetry where each tetrahedron shares one 2-fold axis with
a 2-fold axis of the final compound.
</b></p>

<p><b>
However there is an infinite set compounds of twelve tetrahedra with the same
symmetry as this one, where each tetrahedron shares a 2-fold axis with a 4-fold
axis. Such a compound isn't rigid; each tetrahedron, or actually each pair of
tetrahedra, can be rotated around such a shared axis. Interesting enough when I
searched the internet for a compound of twelve tetrahedra I found one special
angle in this set, instead of the one that is shown here.

This model is a bit less than 18 cm in diameter, which is around 7 inches and
it was finished in June 2023.
