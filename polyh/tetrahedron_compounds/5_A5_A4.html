<p><b>
This is a the well known compound of 5 tetrahedra that has all the rotational
symmetries of a dodecahedron.
This polyhedron is also a
<a href="../icosahedra/index.html">a stellation of the icosahedron</a>.
In "The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra" by Coxeter e.a. it is mentioned as the
46th stellation or by cell names "E </b>f<sub>1</sub><b>".
</b></p>

<p><b>
I built a model of this one somewhere in the 80s
after visiting Science Museum in London. I bought a book with a ready template
and I remember that I thought it was very hard. It must have been one of the
first polyhedra that I built. I am not sure what happened with the model. I must
have thrown it when I moved to Sweden.
</b></p>

<p><b>
I decided to make a new model using the same material and colours as for the
other compound of tetrahedra that I built. The model only consists of 60
facelets, the minimum for a polyhedron with 60 symmetries, but it is still a
model that requires some planning and patience. This is quite common for a model
without reflections.
This model was built in Januari 2024.
