<p><b>
This is a a compound of 30 tetrahedra with all rotational symmetries of an
icosahedron. There are 60 symmetries there and for this kind of compound a
tetrahedron shares a 2-fold axis with the compound. This way you will get a
compound of 30 tetrahedra.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This kind of compound has rotation freedom, and that means that there are
infinite many of these by rotating each tetrahedron around the shared 2-fold
axis; naturally all with the same amount.
</b></p>

<p><b>
This one is however special, since normally the compound can be divided into 6
compounds of 5 tetrahedra with the same symmetry. This symmetry has a 5-fold
symmetry axis without any reflections. For this angle however the subcompound
does have reflections.
</b></p>

<p><b>
Another nice feature is that this compound of thirty tetrahedra doesn't have
too many facelets and hence it is reasonably easy to build, even though it is
quite often hard to build chiral models (i.e. models that only have rotational
symmetries).
</b></p>

<p><b>
This model is around 14 cm in diameter, `hich is more or less 5.5 inchr, and it was
finished just after Christmas in 2023.
