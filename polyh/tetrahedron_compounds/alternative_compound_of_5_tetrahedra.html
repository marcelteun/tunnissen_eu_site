<p><b>
This is an alternative compound of five tetrahedra with the same symmetry as one
tetrahedron. It is the same as the classical compound of four tetrahedra with one
tetrahedron added according to the symmetry. This is a trivial thing to do
and therefore
I was surprised that I couldn't find a model for this alternative way on the internet,
but I am positive that many have done this before me.
Only four colours are needed for this compound of five.
Each of the four in the classical compound of four have their own separate
colour, but the fitfh one uses four different colours,
which is a bit hard to see
since you can only see one face of the fifth one,
but it is easier to see when you use the 3D model next to it.
I built this model in Februari 2021 and the height is around 9 cm (3.6 inch)
