      In March 2021 George Hart posted
      <a target="extern" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1tAv3cfmvI">a video</a>
      about the Sharpohedron.
      That name he coined because it was mentioned by Abraham Sharp at the end of the
      17th century.
      I forwarded the linkt to the video to Don Romano and he guickly built a model.
      He also constructed a model of a compound of two of these as shown in the
      picture below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img align=middle border=0 src="sharperhedron.png"></img>
      </p>

      <p>
      It reminded him of
      <a target="extern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_ditrigonal_icosidodecahedron">Wenninger's number 70</a>
      consisting of pentagrams and triangles.
      I noticed that the three green triangles around one side of a 3-fold axis didn't
      really lie in one plane.
      If you would truncate more from this model to get the triplet of crosses to lie
      in one plane you would get a
      <a target="extern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron">Stella Octangula</a>.
      Besides the problem with the triangles, the purple faces weren't really "tetragrams", since these would be
      crosses with infinite legs.
      Therefore I decided to start with crosses consisting of 5 squares (instead of infinite
      legs) and I quickly found
      <a href="swissohedron.html">a polyhedron</a>
      that was more similar to Wenninger's #70.
      </p>

      <p>
      I liked the result, it was quite a simple and charming polyhedron.
      Shortly after it was named Swissohedron since it reminded me of a Swiss flag, but I
      couldn't imagine I would be the first to have stumbled on this one and I decided
      to ask on
      <a target="extern" href="https://www.software3d.com/Forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=523&p=2242">the Stella Forum</a>,
      where Ulrich Mikloweit answered that it could be found
      <a target="extern" href="https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/12830/41/0/">on page 41</a>
      of Wenzel Jamnitzer‘s Perspectiva Corporum Regularium from 1568.
      In fact you could even found the compound of the two Sharpohedra there
      <a target="extern" href="https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/12830/39/0/">on another page</a>.
      One might wonder whether we were thinking in the same lines when deriving these.
      </p>

      <p>
      After mentioning this on the forum, together with Ulrich and Don we found some
      more polyhedra with crosses, which we called crossohedra by lack of any better
      name. I wouldn't be surprised if others have looked at this area before us,
      though.
      This page contains some models of these "Crossohedra" that we found.
      </p>

        Below follows a list of model found by Don Romano, Ulrich Mikloweit and
        Marcel Tünnissen.

      <p>
      The table below show Crossohedra consisting of elongated crosses. Only one
      kind is accepted: there where two opposite legs constist of square that
      are congruent to the one in the centre and the other opposite legs are
      congruent rectangles. Note that one could extend all the other legs to the
      same length as the other legs instead.
      I choose to keep those squares however.
      For instance the first one could look like
      <button onclick="show_with_title('{5/2}-based',
        'off/crosso-D10D5_2-o2.off', 25, {has_concave_faces:true})">this</button>
      instead
