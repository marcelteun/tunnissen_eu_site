      In March 2021 George Hart posted
      <a target="extern" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1tAv3cfmvI">a video</a>
      about the Sharpohedron.
      That name he coined because it was mentioned by Abraham Sharp at the end of the
      17th century.
      I forwarded the linkt to the video to Don Romano and he guickly built a model.
      He also constructed a model of a compound of two of these as shown in the
      picture below.
      </p>

      <p>
	<img src="sharperhedron.png" alt="image of compound of two Sharpohedra">
      </p>

      <p>
      It reminded him of
      <a target="extern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_ditrigonal_icosidodecahedron">Wenninger's number 70</a>
      consisting of pentagrams and triangles.
      I noticed that the three green triangles around one side of a 3-fold axis didn't
      really lie in one plane.
      If you would truncate more from this model to get the triplet of crosses to lie
      in one plane you would get a
      <a target="extern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron">Stella Octangula</a>.
      Besides the problem with the triangles, the purple faces weren't really "tetragrams", since these would be
      crosses with infinite legs.
      Therefore I decided to start with crosses consisting of 5 squares (instead of infinite
      legs) and I quickly found
      <a href="swissohedron.html">a polyhedron</a>
      that was more similar to Wenninger's #70.
      </p>

      <p>
      I liked the result, it was quite a simple and charming polyhedron.
      Shortly after it was named Swissohedron since it reminded me of a Swiss flag, but I
      couldn't imagine I would be the first to have stumbled on this one and I decided
      to ask on
      <a target="extern" href="https://www.software3d.com/Forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=523&p=2242">the Stella Forum</a>,
      where Ulrich Mikloweit answered that it could be found
      <a target="extern" href="https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/12830/41/0/">on page 41</a>
      of Wenzel Jamnitzer‘s Perspectiva Corporum Regularium from 1568.
      In fact you could even found the compound of the two Sharpohedra there
      <a target="extern" href="https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/12830/39/0/">on another page</a>.
      One might wonder whether we were thinking in the same lines when deriving these.
      </p>

      <p>
      After mentioning this on the forum, together with Ulrich and Don we found some
      more polyhedra with crosses, which we called crossohedra by lack of any better
      name. I wouldn't be surprised if others have looked at this area before us,
      though.
      This page contains some models of the "Crossohedra" that we found.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you would loosely define a Crossohedron any polyhedron with crosses
      and you think of a cross as consisting of 5 quadrilaterals,
      then we only concentrated us on orthogonal crosses with the following
      properties:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  The centre always is a square.
	</li><li>
	  One pair of opposite legs are squares as well (congruent to the one in
	  the centre.
	</li><li>
	  The other pair consists of two congruent rectangles.
	</li><li>
	  All crosses in the polyhedron are congruent.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Note though that I don't want to force the interpretation of the cross
	here. You can either see the cross as consisting of two intersecting
	rectangles or as a concave equilateral dodecagon (which is equivalent as
	5 planar squares). In the former there are 4 short edges and 4 long
	edges to be connected, in the latter there are 12 edges to be connected.
	We will not consider the cross as consiting of one rectangle and 2
	squares (all disconnected).
      </p>

      <p>
	Below follows a list of model found by Don Romano, Ulrich Mikloweit and
	Marcel Tünnissen.

      <p>
      There exists an infinite series of Crossohedra
      with prism symmetry and crosses on 2-fold axes where the shorter
      edges meet in a {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>m</sub>} while the longer edges
      meet in a {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>k</sub>},
      while for m and k hold 1 &ge; k, m &ge; m<sub>max</sub>,
      k &gt; m and n &ge; 5. Note that {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>1</sub>} = {n}
      </p>
       
      <p>
      If any {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>m</sub>} is considered with n &ge; 5 and
      m = m<sub>max</sub>
      where m<sub>max</sub> = <sup>n+1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> if n odd
      or m<sub>max</sub> = <sup>n-2</sup>/<sub>2</sub> if n even.
      If n is even then the faces are parallel and the extra faces will
      not change.
      </p>
       
      <p>
      If n is odd then the length of one pair of the longer edges can be
      adjusted so that one can use squares at the end.
      For any valid values of m &lt; m<sub>max</sub>
      the length of those edges can be adjusted to a
      {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>k</sub>} with
      k &gt; m.
      </p>
       
      <p>
      Exceptions are cases where the opposite legs of the crosses need to
      be shortened to length 0 or less, e.g. in case of
      {<sup>8</sup>/<sub>3</sub>}.
      </p>
       
      <p>
      Examples are given below. The name
      {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>m</sub>}-to-{<sup>n</sup>/<sub>k</sub>}
      is used the the former specifies how the short edges meet and the
      latter how the long edges meet.
      </p>

      <p>
      The other legs of the crosses could also be extend, or one could allow for
      different widths, but only one kind is accepted:
      there where two opposite legs constist of
      square that are congruent to the one in the centre and the other opposite
      legs are congruent rectangles. Note that one could extend all the other
      legs to the same length as the other legs instead.
      To allow this, the requirements that are listed above need to be adjusted.
      For this reason I chose to keep those squares, but just to show an example:
      the "{5}-to-{<sup>5</sup>/<sub>2</sub>} could also be presented
      like
      <button onclick="show_with_title('{5/2}-based',
	'off/crosso-D10D5_2-o2.off', 25, {has_concave_faces:true})">this</button>
      instead.

      <p>
      It is also possible to connect the long edges in the mid-section of the prisms
      and form {<sup>n</sup>/<sub>m</sub>} and then adjust the top and bottom part.
      There isosceles {2n/k} polygons are obtained and an additional n
      rectangles are needed to fill the gaps.
      One can use crosses consisting of 5 squares,
      or one can choose to adjust the length of the two
      opposite legs of the cross to fill the gaps at the top and the bottom with
      squares instead.

      However these Crossohedra aren't part of this listing as mentioned above
      since it was required to keep the quadrilateral in the centre a square.

      Some of the polyhedra can be turned into toroids.
      No serious effort to explore this area has been taken here and the listing
      here just holds some examples that looked interesting.
      So far no toroids were found that only consisted of regular faces, i.e.
      that might belong to Steward's toroids (<a href="#BStew01">[BStew01]</a>),
      with the exception of the aplanar rule for the crosses only
      (i.e. a cross is considered to consist of five co-planar squares).
      </p>

      <p>
      The table below shows some toroids. Variants of these with different genus
      can be made. The toroids below have irregular parts. One can choose where
      to place this irregularity. For instance one can put it in the kernel, the
      tunnels, or at the outside (the crosses). Here it was chosen to put it in
      the tunnels.
