In March 2021 George Hart posted
<a target="extern" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1tAv3cfmvI">a video</a>
about the Sharpohedron.
That name he coined because it was mentioned by Abraham Sharp at the end of the
17th century.
I forwarded the linkt to the video to Don Romano and he guickly built a model.
He also constructed a model of a compound of two of these as shown in the
picture below.

It reminded him of
<a target="extern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_ditrigonal_icosidodecahedron">Wenninger's number 70</a>
consisting of pentagrams and triangles.
I noticed that the three green triangles around one side of a 3-fold axis didn't
really lie in one plane. 
If you would truncate more from this model to get the triplet of crosses to lie
in one plane you would get a
<a target="extern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron">Stella Octangula</a>.
Besides the problem with the triangles, the purple faces weren't really "tetragrams", since these would be
crosses with infinite legs.
Therefore I decided to start with crosses consisting of 5 squares (instead of infinite
legs) and I quickly found
<a href="swissohedron.html">a polyhedron</a>
that was more similar to Wenninger's #70.

I liked the result, it was quite a simple and charming polyhedron.
Shortly after it was named Swissohedron since it reminded me of a Swiss flag, but I
couldn't imagine I would be the first to have stumbled on this one and I decided
to ask on 
<a target="extern" href="https://www.software3d.com/Forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=523&p=2242">the Stella Forum</a>,
where Ulrich Mikloweit answered that it could be found 
<a target="extern" href="https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/12830/41/0/">on page 41</a>
of Wenzel Jamnitzerâ€˜s Perspectiva Corporum Regularium from 1568.
In fact you could even found the compound of the two Sharpohedra there
<a target="extern" href="https://digital.slub-dresden.de/werkansicht/dlf/12830/39/0/">on another page</a>.
One might wonder whether we were thinking in the same lines when deriving these.

After mentioning this on the forum, together with Ulrich and Don we found some
more polyhedra with crosses, which we called crossohedra by lack of any better
name. I wouldn't be surprised if others have looked at this area before us,
though.
This page contains some models of these "Crossohedra" that we found.
