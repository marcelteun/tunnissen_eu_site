<p><b>
  This is a variant of the Swissohedron with the crosses a bit closer to the
  centre of the polyhedron.
  See more about corossohedra <a href="./list.html">here</a>.
</b></p>

<p><b>
  Depending whether you interprete the crosses that consist of 5 squares as
  concave equilateral dodecagons or as 2 intersecting rectangles with a ratio of
  1:3, this polyhedron either consists of 12 crosses and 32 congruent equilateral
  triangles or of 12 crosses, 8 small equilateral triangles and 8 bigger
  equilateral triangles.
  In case of the latter this polyhedron is isogonal.
  One can also see this polyhedron as an octahedron with a tetrahemihexahedron
  attached to each triangle.

<p><b>
  The model was built in 2021 and the smallest edge length is 2.5 cm (1 inch).
  The diameter is around 8.5 cm (3.3 inch).
