<p><b>
  This polyhedron is a toroidal <a href="./list.html#TC">crossohedron</a>.
  It consists of a cuboctahedron centre with a swissohedron on the outside.
  The tunnels are made of eight octahedra connecting the triangles of the
  cuboctahedron and the swissohedron.
  The octahedra give the appearance to be regular, but ther aren't; the edge
  ratio is 1:2/&radic;(15-8&radic;2) which is around 1:1.04
  The model was found and built in 2021.

  It is hard to show the final result with a single picture.
  I shared a video taken with my telephone
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keXBhkgSZZk">on Youtube</a>
  where are try to show the inside.
  With the 3D model on the right it is possible to remove the swissohedron so
  that you can see the inner structure of cuboctahedron with the eight
  octahedra.
  What you cannot see here (neither in the film) is the beautiful effect of a
  kaleidoscope, when you put your eye in the triangular opening of a tunnel and
  play with the reflections of the light coming from the other openings.
