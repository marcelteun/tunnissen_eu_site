<p><b>
  This polyhedron is a toroidal <a href="./list.html#TC">crossohedron</a>.
  It consists of four crosses that can be seen as 5 edge-to-edge connected
  squares,
  16 equilateral triangles and 16 rhombs.
  The rhombs consist of 2 edge-to-edge connected equilateral triangles,
  which means that this toroid would have been part of Steward's toroids 
  <a href="#BStew01">[BStew01]</a>
  if not for the aplanar (A) rule.
  This polyhedron was found by Don Romano in 2021.

<p><b>
  The model was built in 2021 and the smaller edge length is 2.5 cm (1 inch),
  which gives it a height of 7 cm (2.8 inch).
  It surprised me that it is very rigid,
  but the rhombs prevent the square shaped tunnel to be deformed, of course.
  I started to build the tunnel first and because of that it felt I had to
  finish the model four times.

<p><b>
  As the picture below shows the model seems to exist of 'M's and 'W's. One
  could use it to honour Magnus Wenninger with a crown.
