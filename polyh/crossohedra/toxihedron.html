<p><b>
  This is the inflated Swissohedron with some parts cut away.
  The base of this polyhedron is a Stella Octangula.
</b></p>

<p><b>
  The model was built in 2021 and the edge length is 2.5 cm (1 inch)
  and the diameter of the model is 13 cm (~5.1 inch).
  When you look into a 3-fold axis of this model you see something that reminds
  me of the warning symbol for nuclear waste.
  This is why I like to refer to this model as the toxihedron (i.e. 'tox'
  doesn't refer to edge at all in this case)

  The picture below shows the non-faceted and the faceted models next to each
  other.
