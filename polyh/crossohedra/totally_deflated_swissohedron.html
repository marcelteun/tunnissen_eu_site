<p><b>
  This is a variant of the Swissohedron where the crosses are moved towards each
  other so that two opposite crosses meet.
  Then only half of the other faces are used and these are organised in a
  tetrahedral fashion. See more about corossohedra
  <a href="./list.html">here</a>.
</b></p>

<p><b>
  The model was built in 2021 and the smallest edge length is 2.5 cm (1 inch).
  The height of the model is 6 cm (~2.4 inch).
</b></p>

<p><b>
  This crossohedron is closely related to Steward's
  4Q<sub>3</sub>(S<sub>3</sub>) used in Chapter VI of <a href="#BStew01">[BStew01]</a>
  It is a bit hard to recognise the crosses in this one since one pair of the
  legs can be seen from one direction, while the other pair is only seen from
  the opposite direction.
  In the picture below a half-finished version of this model is shown. Here you
  can recognise one cross.

  deflated to inflated with crosses of the same size.
