I derived this model from a Trapezoidal Icositetrahedron, which consists of 24
kites. It is a beautiful variant of the dual of a Rhombicuboctahedron.
The variant is described <a href="trap24/index.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
It can be derived from this variant by using the fact that both this variant
and the Rhombic Dodecahedron have a ring of six faces that are parallel to an
3-fold axis.
</p><p>
I am not sure when I derived and built this model, but
I guess it must have been around 1998.
Most of the calculations were done by hand,
but if I remember well I started using an algebraic system towards the end.
The pieces were drawn by hand using a ruler and pencil and cut out by scissors.
</p><p>
The model belongs to the symmetry group of the Tetrahedron multiplied by the
central inversion, indicated by Coxeter as A4 x {I}. 
I built this one to derive a compound of twelve cubes that consists of four
classic compounds of three cubes.
Later on I found that there are many of them. Never mind this one has the
special relationship with the Trapezoidal Icositretrahedron.
