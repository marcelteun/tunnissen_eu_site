      Building these projections of polychora gives a new dimension to
      constructing models. You have think ahead more than with polyhedra and
      sometimes you need to adjust for the thickness of the material. Sometimes
      the non-transparent parts are visible from both sides, so they need to be
      cut and pasted twice. 
      Since building these models is so different I gathered some tips that
      might be helpful. This page is mainly meant for myself and will probably
      evolve gradually in time.
      </p><p>
      For the non-transparent parts I use 250 gr/m<sup>2</sup>. For the
      transparent part I use the overhead sheet meant for inkjet printers. I use
      the sheets with the rough sides, since the ink releases under influence of
      the glue when using the sheets that don't have this rough side (even
      though they are still meant for inkjet printers).
      I find it handly to cut all parts with scissors, other people might prefer
      a ruler and knive. Anyway I think it is a good idea to use white paper
      under the sheet to see better where to cut:

      </p><p>
      I always cut all pieces as they are and add the tabs, for which I use
      normal paper, separately later. I do this for the non-transparent faces as
      well since the material is pretty thick. For the tabs between the
      non-transparent faces I print out
      <a href="./tabs.pdf">this PDF file</a>
      and for the tabs connected to transparent faces I print out 
      <a href="./tabsTrans.pdf">this PDF file</a>. 
      With a sharp point and a ruler I go over the folding line and fold it
      before cutting of a stroke of paper. Usually I cut one tab on length
      to use that one as a template for others.
      </p><p>
      The transparent tabs I glue
      onto the rough side of the sheet and let a dry some time, while I continue
      with other things. Then when the glue is dry enough I fold the tab back
      (i.e. in a way that the tab will come off if not glued well) to test
      whether the whole tab is fastened well. If it is glued well I cut off
      more if needed (e.g. if the other face is transparent as well).
      </p><p>
      Since more than two faces share an edge you have to plan ahead a bit more.
      I find it handy to start with gluing together the tabs of the transparent
      faces that meet and then glue the result onto a non-transparent face,
      though this is not <i>always</i> the best way forard.
      </p><p>
      Usually I add layer after layer, since sometimes the sizes of the faces
      need to be increased, because of inprecision and the thickness of the
      material.
