      <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>
      Polychora are the equivalent of polyhedra, but then in the fourth
      dimension. Since we just live in a three dimensional Euclidean world it is
      hard for us to imagine how a polychoron "looks" like in "reality". I would
      suggest not to try. There are other techniques to learn to understand
      these objects.
      </p>
      <p>
      One can for instance look at the net of one. The net for a
      cube is obtained by cutting along the edges and unfolding the area to a
      flat shape. One such shape can be a cross consisting of 6 squares. For the
      4 dimensional hypercube the net consists of 8 cubes, e.g. in the shape of
      a 3 dimensional cross.
      </p>
      <p>
      Another way to study 4 dimensional objects is to look at cross sections.
      For a cube cross sections can for instance be a triangle or a hexagon.
      </p>
      <p>
      A third way of studying polychora is to project them to the third
      dimension. The models that are shown here are all projected to the third
      dimension by a perspective projection. The result consists of cells within
      cells and as a consequence either faces need to be left out or faces need
      to be transparent to investigate the cells that are located inside.
      I chose the latter

      The model above is a
      <a target=new href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectified_5-cell">
        rectified pentachoron</a>.
      As the name suggests it can be
      derived from the pentachoron, which consists of 5 tetrahedra. In this
      model the tetrahedra have become octahedra and the vertices, where 4
      tetrahedra meet, have become tetrahedra.
      All octahedra consist of 4 transparent and 4
      non-transparent yellow faces; all tetrahedra just consist of
      non-transparent yellow faces.
      A small video clip makes all a bit clearer:

      The fourth dimension consists of volumes that can be parallel or
      intersect, just like planes can (in the third dimension).
      In the model above the perspective projection
      deforms all the 5 octahedra except for 1; the octahedron that encapsulates
      the whole model.
      Similarly the projection deforms all 5 tetrahedra except for one: the one
      in the centre of the model. The octahedron on the outside and the
      tetrahedron at the centre are not deformed, because in the fourth
      dimension they are positioned in volumes that
      parallel to the projection volume that is . the volume we live in.
      The octahedron is bigger, since that volume is the closest to the camera
      point. The deformed octahedra and tetrahedra are not parallel to the
      projection volume, i.e. they
      intersect the volumes of the outer octahedron and centre tetrahedron. The
      intersections are the faces of these polyhedra.

      <p>
      The model above is the projection of a
      <a target=new href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectified_tesseract">
        rectified tesseract</a>, which is a four dimensional hypercube.
      As the name suggests it can be
      derived from the tesseract or hypercube, which consists of 8 cubes. In the
      rectified tesseract the cubes have become cuboctahedra and the vertices,
      which are shared by 4 cubes, have become tetrahedra. In the model all the
      tetrahedra are (non-transparent) blue in the cuboctahedra the squares
      are transparent (red) and the triangles are blue. Two cuboctahedra are not
      deformed by the perspective projection. Those are the outer one and the
      one in the centre. Both are in a volume that is parallel to the projection
      volume. Again the outer cuboctahedron is closest to the camera point and
      the inner is the furthest away from the camera point.
      Again a small video clip makes all a bit clearer:

      <h2><a name="rect24">Rectified 24 cell</a></h2>
      The model below is a projection of the 
      <a target=new href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectified_24-cell">
      rectified 24 cell</a>.
      The 24 cell consists of 24 octahedra and every vertex is shared by 6
      octahedra, which will become the 6 squares of a cube, when rectifying. The
      octahedra will become cuboctahedra. Thus the rectified 24 cell consists of
      24 cuboctahedra and 24 cubes:

      From just a picture it is difficult to see how the model looks inside. The
      image below shows some stages of the construction, so it easier to
      understand how the model is built up:

      Currently I am constructing the 
      <a target=new href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectified_24-cell">
      rectified 24 cell</a>.
      The picture below shows the progression of the
      construction (at the last stage the model needs to be closed only, i.e.
      the outer squares and triangles need to be attached):
