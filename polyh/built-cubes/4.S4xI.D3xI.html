<p><b>
This polyhedron model of Bakos' beautiful compound consists of 4 cubes and the
whole compound has the symmetry of one cube. It was published by T.Bakos in
1959. What I like about the model that for each side of a cube the same pieces
are needed to build a model.
In total you will only need three different kinds of pieces. A template for building
this model can be found <A HREF="templates/4.S4xI.D3xI.pdf">here</A>.

<p><b>
On the background there is a musix CD from Kelly Joe Phelps called "Sky Like a
Broken Clock". At the time of building the model I listened a lot to that CD.

<p><b>
Years after building this model I found a way to put three of Bakos' compounds
into one compound of 12 cubes. A model of that polyhedron can be found
