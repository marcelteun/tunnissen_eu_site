<p><b>
This is the rigid compound of cubes with the most amount of cubes.
The term rigid means that it doesn't have any rotational freedom,
i.e. there is only one possible way to organise a compound of 15 cubes with this
symmetry.
Only fundamental cube compounds are considered, otherwise one could combine this
one with the classical compound of five cubes.
The compound of 15 cubes can be seen as a multiplication of the the classical
compound of five cubes and the classical compound of three cubes, since it
consists of five classical compounds of three cubes, organised in the same way
as the cubes are organised in the classical compound of five cubes.

The first time I saw a model of this was in the book "Symmetry Orbits" by Hugo
Verheyen.
The book shows a model built by Magnus Wenninger.
That model is a simplification of the real model because 360 of the smallest
pieces are left out.
This model here has all these small pieces included.
The picture below shows their size compared to my finger.

<p><b>
The model took around 170 hours to build
spread of over 11 months.
In between I had some breaks during which I built something else.
The model was finished in October 2020.
The edge length on one cube is around 14.5 cm (5.7 inch)
and the smallest length to be cut just 1 mm.
