<p><b>
  This is a compound of 10 cubes identified by
  10A | <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> x <i>I</i> / <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> x <i>I</i>,
  as described in H.F. Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
  This means that the compound has the same symmetry as a icosahedron and one
  cube shares an order three symmetry axis with the compound, including the
  mirror planes through that axis.
  Since two versions with these properties exist, they are divided into an 'A' and
  a 'B' variant. This is the 'A' variant.

  The model itself is built with 250 gr/m<sup>2</sup>
  Chromolux paper
  using the colour "pearl". This colour was chosen, because otherwise the
  logical decision would be to use 10 different colours and it is hard to find
  10 different colours that fit well together. I like the final result, which
  look a bit like a crystal, while pearls are round. It also gives a beautiful
  effect when rotating the model in the light.

<p><b>
  It took around 50 hours to construct the model (divided over seven weeks). The
  model is a bit harder to build than the 'B' variant, because it has some very
  small edges. On the other hand it doesn't have a vertex where many faclets
  meet. The size is the same as the one 'B' variant I built: the radius is a bit
  less than 14 cm (around 5.5 inch)  and I call the pair 'Mr and Mrs'.
  The model was finished somewhere in the end of August 2019.
