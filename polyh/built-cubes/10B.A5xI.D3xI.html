<p><b>
  This is a compound of 10 cubes identified by
  10B | <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> x <i>I</i> / <i>D</i><sub>3</sub> x <i>I</i>,
  as described in H.F.Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
  This means that the compound has the same symmetry as a icosahedron and one
  cube shares an order three symmetry axis with the compound, including the
  mirror planes through that axis.
  Since two versions with these properties exist, they are divided into an 'A' and
  a 'B' variant. This is the 'B' variant.

  The model itself is built with 250 gr/m<sup>2</sup>
  Chromolux paper
  using the colour "pearl". This colour was chosen, because otherwise the
  logical decision would be to use 10 different colours and it is hard to find
  10 different colours that fit well together. I like the final result, which
  look a bit like a crystal, while pearls are round. It also gives a beautiful
  effect when rotating the model in the light.

  It took around 40 hours to construct the model (divided over five weeks). It
  is actually a model that is quite easy to build. It consists of 30 parts that
  are all the same. The only problem is that 20 pieces of cardboard come
  together at one point, and it is impossible to prevent getting holes there.
  They aren't real holes b.t.w, since I filled them with glue. The radius of the
  model is a bit less than 14 cm (around 5.5 inch). The model was finished
  somewhere in March 2019.
