The classic compound of three cubes is a well known model which can be found on
M.C. Escher's Waterfall for instance. It is a beautiful model with
cube symmetry. It looks like a simple model, but it is not that easy to build; it
is in fact rather difficult to get the lines straight.

<p><b>
If you add one cube
according to the symmetry, you will get

model, which is easier to build and less
work, since you will only have to cut and paste 96 pieces instead of 120.
