This is a model I am really proud of.
I like this one a lot, because it is full of cube symmetry.
For years and years I was hoping to find this one.
Later I gave up and I thought <A HREF="./Cp4x3Cla.htm">another model</A>
would be the best approximation that exists. 
Finally I found that it <I>was</I> possible and enthousiastically I started
developing the idea.
However building this model took me a long time, not only because the model
contains such tiny faces, but also because the summer of 2002 was incredibly
beautiful in Sweden and I didn't want to spend too much time indoors.

The model belongs to the group
12<I>B</I>|<I>S</I><SUB>4</SUB>x<I>I|C</I><SUB>2</SUB>x<I>I</I>
as described in H.F.Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
This one appears for the angle &#0956;=(1/2)atan((4/7)&#8730;2) 
However this one is special, because it has a property that other compounds in
that group do not have: it can be divided into 4 subcompounds of 3
cubes, which also have cube symmetry, i.e. it consists of 4 
<A HREF="./ClassiC.htm">classic compounds of 3 cubes</A>.

As I said, the model is stuffed with cube symmetry: it consists of 12 cubes, it consists of 4 classic compounds, and the whole model has cube symmetry!
