This is a model I am really proud of.
I like this one a lot, because it is full of cube symmetry.
For years and years I was trying to find somehting like this.
Later I gave up and I thought <A HREF="./Cp4x3Cla.htm">another model</A>
would be the best approximation that exists.
Finally I found that it <I>was</I> possible and enthousiastically I started
developing the idea.
However building this model took me a long time, not only because the model
contains such tiny faces, but also because the summer of 2002 was incredibly
beautiful in Sweden and I didn't want to spend too much time indoors.

<p><b>
The model belongs to the group
12<i>B</i>|<i>S</i><sub>4</sub>x<i>I|C</i><sub>2</sub>x<i>I</i>
as described in H.F.Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
This one appears for the angle &#0956;=(1/2)atan((4/7)&#8730;2), but the angle
isn't mentioned. In fact the special position isn't mentioned at all (which was
the reason I gave up the idea for a while).
This one is special, because it has a property that other compounds in
that group do not have: it can be divided into 4 subcompounds of 3
cubes, which also have cube symmetry, i.e. it consists of
4 <a href="./ClassiC.htm">classic compounds of 3 cubes</a>.
</b></p>

<p><b>
As I said, the model is stuffed with cube symmetry: it consists of 12 cubes,
each sub-compound of one colour has cube symmetry, and the whole model has cube
symmetry!
