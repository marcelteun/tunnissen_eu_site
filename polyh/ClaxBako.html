  If you have a VRML plugin
  you can see and investigate the complete polyhedron
  <a href="./CubeCompounds/12.S4xI.D1xI.mu5.wrl">here</a>.
  (You can <a target="new" href="http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/vbdetect.html">check here</a> and
  find available plugins for your browser/OS.)
  The polyhedron is a compound of 12 cubes and belongs to the symmetry group
  12|<i>S</i><sub>4</sub>x<i>I|D</i><sub>1</sub>x<i>I</i>&#0956;,
  as described in H.F.Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
  The angle &#0956; uniquely identifies one compound in the group and may
  vary between 0 and 45 degrees (with 0 and 45 not included).
  For some angles &#0956; the compound has some special properties.
  For this compound the angle &#956;=(1/2)atan((4/7)&#8730;2)
  and for that angle the compound can be divided into three
  <a href="./Bakos.htm">Bakos compound</a>s
  (4|<i>S</i><sub>4</sub>x<i>I|D</i><sub>3</sub>x<i>I</i>)
  For each Bakos compound holds that one of the fourfold axes is shared with a
  fourfold axis of the compound; the other two axes share a twofold axis with the
  compound.

<p><b>
  This compound can be seen as a twin of
  <a href="./BakoxCla.htm">this compound</a>,
  since it can be interpreted as a multiplication between
  <a href="./Bakos.htm">Bakos' compound</a>
  and 
  <a HREF="./ClassiC.htm">the classic compounds of 3 cubes</a>, where 
  <a href="./BakoxCla.htm">the twin compound</a>
  can be seen as a multiplication between the Classic compound and Bakos.

  If you are interested,
  <a href="./templates/c12s4.pdf">here</a>
  is a document that describes how the templates were calculated.
  It also contains the templates and the adjusted templates that I am using, since
  some faces became so tiny that is was not very practical to build an exact
  model.
  <a href="./pics/ClaxBako.history.jpg">Here</a> you can see how I built the model.
