      <p>This page and the models are generated by a Python script <a href="#mtun03">[MTUN3]</a>, which requires the package <a href="#mtun01">[MTUN1]</a>. The models are displayed with help of a simple OFF file viewer written in JavaScript <a href="#mtun02">[MTUN2]</a>.

      <h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>During fall 2025 the Mason Green's <button onclick="player.show('off/cupola_7_2__7_1_0.off', 'Small Supersemicupola', {'has_concave_faces': true})">Small Supersemicupola</button> and his <button onclick="player.show('off/cupola_7_3__7_2_0.off', 'Great Supersemicupola', {'has_concave_faces': true})">Great Supersemicupola</button> fascinated me and I wondered whether I could use some general rule, other than Mason's rules. to generate more of these. The polyhedra describe here I called roof top polyhedra, and they are all nn3-acrohedra, where n is a rational number.

      <div id="about">
        <p>The main inspiration for the research came from <a href="#mcnei01">[MCNE1]</a>, There it is stated that a 993-acrohedron hasn't been found yet. I didn't have any illusions that I would find one, but it caught my interest and I became curious about what the problem could be. I wanted to build up some understanding. I did have contact with Jim McNeill and he send me some explanation, but I started with ignoring those comments, since I was afraid that it would lead me into a direction that had already been investigated.
        </p>
        <p>My first attempts went in to another direction than what is discussed here. After some more contact with Jim I, used the following way of interpreting the small and great supersemicupola. They both consist of sides that can be interpreted as roof tops, where two congruent faces share an edge and to both vertices equilateral triangles are added. Then these roof tops are connected to a base with n-fold symmetry and these roof tops are orbited according to this rotational symmetry.
        </p>
        <p>The fascinating thing is that for the Supersemicupolae everything magically fits. I wondered whether there are more cases. I wondered specifically how this looked for the enneagon, the 993 case. 
        </p>
        <p>Obviously it doesn't work for the enneagon otherwise Mason Green would already have found it. Not surprisingly for the enneagon it just doesn't work. This is how a <button onclick="player.show('off/cupola_9_2__9_1_0.off', 'failed case for n=9', {'has_concave_faces': true})">failed case for n=9</button> can look like. Note that I only show one side of the roof. In the case of n=7 to connect to the next ones. If you add the other side, then you will end up with even more loose edges that don't fit. There are more cases where these roof tops just don't fit. This makes it all the more special that it does work for n=7. 
        </p>
        <p>When it does work out some surprising polyhedra can be found. My friend Don Romano quickly build one that uses pentragrams as roof top sides as shown in the image below. It is a model of this one: <button onclick="player.show('off/cupola_3_1__5_2_0.off', '3/1 base with 5/2 roofs ', {'has_concave_faces': true})">3/1 base with 5/2 roofs </button>.

      <div id="definition">
        <p>TODO

      <div id="off_files">
        <p>All OFF files that are use on this web page can be found 
          <a href="off">here</a>. However this web site uses a simple OFF file viewer <a href="#mtun02">[MTUN2]</a> that has problems with showing self-intersecting polygons. Therefore the OFF files are adjusted so that the outlines of the polygons are shown. This means that edges will be split. I understand that if you would like to view these in Stella then it will generate an error that edges have an odd amount of faces attached. 
        </p>
        <p>Besides that to show the models in some interesting angle, The script that generates them uses the X-axis ase the n-fold axis. After that I rotate them 105° around the X-axis first, then -20° around the Y-axis. Here I follow the convention that the X-axis points towards the left, the Y-axis points upwards, and the Z-axis points towards the viewer.

      <div id="thanks">
        <p>First of all thanks to Jim McNeill for the inspiration and discussion. I am sorry that I don't take so much time to return the favour. Also thank you Don Romano for fruitful discussions and pointing out mistakes. Thank you Ulrich Mikloweit and Piotr Pawlikowski for listening to me and accepting my spamming of emails, when I think I found something, correcting it, and going back and forth.
