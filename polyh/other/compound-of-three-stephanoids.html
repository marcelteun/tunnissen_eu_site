<p><b>
Here you can see a compound of three stephanoids. A stephanoid, or crown
polyhedron, is a self-intersecting polyhedron with dihedral symmetry consisting
of butterfly faces. This particular compound is organised in such a way that
the dihedral axes of the stephanoids are all orthogal.
</b></p>

<p><b>
The most logical way of colouring the model with three colours would be to give
each stephanoid its own colour, but I chose something else here. The colouring
is still symmetric though: one colour is mapped on itself by a dihedral symmetry
from one of the stephanoids. I thought this way of colouring was more pleasing.
</b></p>

<p><b>
As you can see the model was finished in March 2023 after a suggestion from
Ulrich Mikloweit. He found this one by starting with a rhombic cuboctahedron,
which is the convex hull of this compound.
