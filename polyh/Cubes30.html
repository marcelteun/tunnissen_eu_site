<p><b>
  This is a compound of 30 cubes belonging to the symmetry group
  30 | <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> x <i>I</i> / <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> x <i>I</i> / &mu;,
  as described in H.F.Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
  The angle &mu; uniquely identifies one compound in the group and may
  vary between 0 and 45 degrees (excluding 0 and 45 degrees).
  For some angles '&mu;' the compound has some special properties.
  For this compound the angle &mu; = acos(<sup>&radic;(5+&radic;5)</sup>/<sub>&radic;10</sub>)
  and for that angle the compound can be divided into six base elements:
  5 | <i>D</i><sub>20</sub> x <i>I</i> / <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> x <i>I</i>,
  for which each order 20 symmetry axis shares an order 5 symmetry axis with the compound.
  The "C<sub>2</sub>" in the symmetry group means that each order 2 symmetry axis of the compound is shared by two
  order 2 symmetry axes of two base elements.

  The model itself is built with 250 gr/m<sup>2</sup>
  Chromolux paper
  using the colour "pearl". This colour was chosen, because the model was a
  wedding present for two friends of mine. I thought it was not fitting to use
  another colour and I am pretty satisfied with the result. Since the model is
  quite small for 30 cubes it was difficult to get all the edges straight,
  though I don't think that my friends will complain... though ;)
