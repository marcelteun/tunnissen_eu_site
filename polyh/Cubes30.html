  If you have a VRML plugin
  you can see and investigate the complete polyhedron
  <a href="./CubeCompounds/30A.A5xI.C2xI.mu7.wrl">here</a>.
  (You can <a target="new" href="http://cic.nist.gov/vrml/vbdetect.html">check here</a> and
  find available plugins for your browser/OS.)
  The polyhedron is a compound of 30 cubes and belongs to the symmetry group
  30 | <i>A</i><sub>5</sub> x <i>I</i> / <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> x <i>I</i> / &mu;,
  as described in H.F.Verheyen's Symmetry Orbits.
  The angle &mu; uniquely identifies one compound in the group and may
  vary between 0 and 45 degrees (with 0 and 45 not included).
  For some angles &mu; the compound has some special properties.
  For this compound the angle &mu; = acos(<sup>&radic;(5+&radic;5)</sup>/<sub>&radic;10</sub>)
  and for that angle the compound can be divided into six base elements:
  5 | <i>D</i><sub>20</sub> x <i>I</i> / <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> x <i>I</i>,
  for which each order 20 symmetry axis shares an order 5 symmetry axis with the compound.
  (In the
  <a href="./CubeCompounds/30A.A5xI.C2xI.mu7.wrl">wrl model</a> the base
  elements have different colours.)
  Also holds that each order 2 symmetry axis of the compound is shared by two
  order 2 symmetry axes of two base elements.

  The model itself is built with 250 gr/m<sup>2</sup>
  <a target="new" href="http://www.chromolux.de/en/carton_specs.php">chromolux paper</a>
  using the colour pearl. This colour was chosen, because the model was a
  wedding present for two friends of mine. I thought it was not fitting to use
  another colour and I am pretty satisfied with the result. Since the model is
  quite small for 30 cubes it was difficult to get all the edges straight,
  though I don't think that my friends will complain... ;)
