<b>This is the rigid compound of 6 cubes with cube symmetry.
After finishing a compound of 12 cubes I needed a small project that I could
finish quickly before my wife was due. That became this small model (to get an
idea about the size I put a pair of tweezers in the front).
On the picture above you look more or less into an order 4-axis.
