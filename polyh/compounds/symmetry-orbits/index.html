      <h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>In the book <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> Mr. Verheyen derives all possible groups of cube compounds. <a href="../cubes/index.html">This page</a> is based on that book. The idea to apply group algebra for listing all compounds of polyhedra is great, unfortunately the book is rather dry and hard to understand. I think that Verheyen was strong in the field of abstract theory, but he wasn't very good in explaining this to others. One problem is that the book starts with a lot of abstract definitions without examples and without any explanation of their need or future usage. Besides that there are some small mistakes that make it even harder for the reader sometimes. For this reason I decided to write this page: as a support to read this book. More about this below.

      <div id="about">
        <p>The first chapter of the book enumerates the symmetry groups in 3D Euclidean space. The symmetry groups are based directly on generic group algebra, not on the Sch&ouml;nflies groups, which are based on cristallography. This chapter is of high quality with very clear images and pictures.
        </p>
        <p>The second chapter "Symmtry Action" contains a lot of abstract group algebra and is hard to understand even if you have some basic understanding of group algebra already. The problem that I had with this chapter was that it consists only of formal definitions and there aren't any examples.
        </p>
        <p>If you want to explain to a young child what the square root of a number is and you start with giving some kind of formal definition like this: the square root of a number is that number that if you multiply it by itself then it will give the original number, then chances are that the child will not understand and just think that calculating a square root is very complicated. If on the other hand you start with some examples and say: the square root of four is two, since two times two equals to four and the square root of nine is three, since three times three equals to nine, and perhaps even another example with sixteen, then the child will probably know the answer when you ask what the square root of twentyfive is.
        </p>
        <p>Most of us are good at recognising patterns: our brains see patterns even when there is only noise. Examples serve as the patterns to teach us the general rule, and it is good to start with examples when you try to learn or teach something new. In fact this is the base of science: you start with experimenting to get a feeling of how the something works, and then you try to come up with a general rule. After that you will challenge this general rule with even more experiments, but the fact remains the first experiments and the examples have the same purpose: to build a basic understanding of something new.
        </p>
        <p>Obviously the formal definitions and formulas are an essential part as well. Their purpose is to make sure that everyone has the same understanding and use the exact same terms.
        </p>
        <p>However, all too often these abstract formal definitions are used as the first introduction of a new subject. Though this might be enough for some, most of us need the examples to get a feeling about the subject. I think that in <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> Verheyen made this classical mistake. Formal definitions of terms are given without any examples, and even without stating what this is going to be used for. With this page I hope I can provide some of examples, to help to understand what Verheyen tried to do.

          <li>Page <b>52</b>: D<sub>4</sub>D<sub>2</sub> has 2 reflections, not 3.</li>
          <li>Page <b>53</b>: The text 'Number of mirrors: 3 (Fig. 56a) &plus; 1 (Fig. 56b)' could be misinterpreted. Fig. 56a itself doesn't show 3 mirrors, but there are 3 mirror planes of the type shown in Fig. 56a, where the plane contains one 3-fold and one 2-fold axis. The same improvement can be made when referring to similar images in the next symmetries. </li>
          <li>Page <b>67</b>: In the first sentence in section 1.1 '<b>C</b>' shouldn't be in bold font: it should '<i>C</i>' instead.</li>

This is to close the group. However this would never lead to case 1 as the text says, but it is meant that this new group becomes an <b>F</b><sub>s</sub>, which takes the role of <b>G</b><sub>s</sub> in case 1 since <b>H</b> &#x2282; <b>F</b><sub>s</sub>.</li>
          <li>Page <b>76 (3)</b>: At the bottom of the page the symbol &#x21cb; is used. It would be good to mention what this symbol stands for. I think this symbol is meant to represent the 'equipotent' relation.</li>
          <li>Page <b>77</b>: In the figure title <b>H</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>H</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>G</b><sub>1</sub>, and <b>G</b><sub>2</sub> should be <b>H</b>, <b>H</b><sub><i>s</i></sub>, <b>G</b> and <b>G</b><sub><i>s</i></sub> respectively, I think.
