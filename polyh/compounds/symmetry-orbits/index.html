      <h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>In the book <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> Mr. Verheyen derives all possible groups of cube compounds. <a href="../cubes/index.html">This page</a> is based on that book. The idea to apply group algebra for listing all compounds of polyhedra is great, unfortunately the book is rather dry and hard to understand. I think that Verheyen was strong in the field of abstract theory, but he wasn't very good in explaining this to others. One problem is that the book starts with a lot of abstract definitions without examples and without any explanation of their need or future usage. Besides that there are some small mistakes that make it even harder for the reader sometimes. For this reason I decided to write this page: as a support to read this book. More about this below.

      <div id="about">
        <p>The first chapter of the book enumerates the symmetry groups in 3D Euclidean space. The symmetry groups are based directly on generic group algebra, not on the Sch&ouml;nflies groups, which are based on cristallography. This chapter is of high quality with very clear images and pictures.
        </p>
        <p>The second chapter "Symmetry Action" contains a lot of abstract group algebra and is hard to understand even if you have some basic understanding of group algebra already. The problem that I had with this chapter was that it consists only of formal definitions and there aren't any examples.
        </p>
        <p>In my experience all too often the academic world uses formal definitions to introduce a new concept. Although the formal definitions are important, in my humble opinion examples are the best way to <i>introduce</i> a new subject. This is because our brains are good at recognising patterns: we see patterns even when there is only noise. This is actually also how we built our scientific models: they are based on experiments.
        </p>
        <p>Once someone has some basic understanding, the formal defintions are essential to make sure everybody will have the <i>same</i> understanding, I feel the need to stress this here, since I have come across this problem a lot: where the formal defintions are either given <i>before</i> the examples, or they aren't any exmaples at all.
        </p>
        <p>I think in <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a>, chapter 2 this classical mistake is made as well. Formal definitions of terms are given without any examples, and even without stating what this is going to be used for. With this page I hope I can provide some of examples, to help to understand what Verheyen tried to do.

        <p>It would have been helpful if the book had an index, for this reason I added one here. Note that the index below is by no means complete. It is just some of the terms that that I think can be useful to look up.

          <li>Page <b>39, Figure 38</b>: Figure titles are wrong. (a) perpendicular to a 3-fold axis (10&times;); (b) perpendicular to a 5-fold axis (6&times;); (c) occurs twice for each 2-fold axis in the image (30&times;); (d) perpendicular to a 2-fold axis (30&times;); </li>
          <li>Page <b>39, Table 16</b>: A better title would be 'Icosahedral Angles between m- and n-Fold Axis' and then use 'n' and 'n' on top of the two left-most columns. It would also be good to refer to Firgure 38 for each angle. Between 2-fold and 5-fold axis the 90&deg; angle is missing. It can both be seen in Figure 38b, where the 5-fold axis is perpedicular to the image and Figure 38d, where the 2-fold axis is perpendicular to the image.</li>
          <li>Page <b>52</b>: D<sub>4</sub>D<sub>2</sub> has 2 reflections, not 3.</li>
          <li>Page <b>53, Figure 56</b>: The text 'Number of mirrors: 3 (Fig. 56a) &plus; 1 (Fig. 56b)' could be misinterpreted. Fig. 56a itself doesn't show 3 mirrors, but there are 3 mirror planes of the type shown in Fig. 56a, where the plane contains one 3-fold and one 2-fold axis. The same improvement can be made when referring to similar images in the next symmetries. </li>
          <li>Page <b>67, Section 1.1</b>: In the first sentence '<b>C</b>' shouldn't be in bold font: it should '<i>C</i>' instead.</li>
          <li>Page <b>68, item 3</b>: It would be clearer to state that the two cosets are <b>H</b> and <b>G</b> - <b>H</b></li>
          <li>Page <b>68, section 1.2</b>: The statement <i>A</i> &middot; <b>H</b> &middot; <b>A</b><sup>-1</sup> = <b>H</b> should be <i>A</i> &middot; <b>H</b> &middot; <i>A</i><sup>-1</sup> = <b>H</b> ('A' shouldn't be in bold font).</li>
          <li>Page <b>69, section 1.4</b>: In the expression <i>A</i> * (<i>B</i> &middot; <b>H</b>) = (<i>A</i> &middot; <i>B</i>) &middot; <b>H</b> it is better to write <i>A</i> * (<i>C</i> &middot; <b>H</b>) = (<i>A</i> &middot; <i>C</i>) &middot; <b>H</b> so the character 'C' relates to the definition of q and q'.</li>
          <li>Page <b>72</b>: The sentence 'The sum of these components is again a space-(n-1) body and is composed of space-(n-2) bodies.' is unclear, since the 'sum of components' is undefined. If you put these components, which are space-(n-1) bodies, back in a set, then you would get back the original space-(n) body, not a space-(n-1) body. I think the author might have meant meant the union of these components, with 'the sum of'. In that case you do get a space-(n-1) body. I don't think that the Minkowski sum is meant here.</li>
          <li>Page <b>73-74</b>: The choice of the letter <b>I</b> is a bit unfortunate, since it is also used to denote the central inversion. </li>
          <li>Page <b>74, Section 3, first paragraph</b>: The expression <i>p &isin; V(n)</i> should be <i>p &isin; V<sup>(n)</sup></i>.</li>
          <li>Page <b>74, Section 4</b>: The first sentence would be clearer it the word 'then' is added after the first comma.</li>
          <li>Page <b>75, mapping <i>t</i></b>: <b>G</b> / <b>C</b><i><sub>s</sub></i> should be <b>G</b> / <b>G</b><i><sub>s</sub></i>. It could also be helpful to mention in the line below below for <i>C</i> &middot; <b>G</b><sub>s</sub> that <i>C</i> &isin; <b>G</b></li>
          <li>Page <b>76, first paragraph</b>: <b>G</b><sub>1</sub> should be <b>G</b><sub>s</sub> and <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> should be <i>p</i><sub>s</sub>.</li>
          <li>Page <b>76, case 3</b>: The notation &#x27e8;<b>H</b>, <b>G</b><sub>s</sub> &#x27e9; &#x2282;<b>H</b> means that this set is used as a generator; i.e. the isometries are recursively combined with each other until no new isometries are found. This is to close the group. However this would never lead to case 1 as the text says, but it is meant that this new group becomes an <b>F</b><sub>s</sub>, which takes the role of <b>G</b><sub>s</sub> in case 1 since <b>H</b> &#x2282; <b>F</b><sub>s</sub>.</li>
          <li>Page <b>76, bottom of the page </b>: The symbol &#x21cb; is used. It would be good to mention what this symbol stands for. I think this symbol is meant to represent the 'equipotent' relation.</li>
          <li>Page <b>77</b>: In the figure title <b>H</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>H</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>G</b><sub>1</sub>, and <b>G</b><sub>2</sub> should be <b>H</b>, <b>H</b><sub><i>s</i></sub>, <b>G</b> and <b>G</b><sub><i>s</i></sub> respectively, I think.

      <div id="space_n_body">
        <p>This subject is related to <b>page 71-72</b>. The scetion is quite abstract and some of the definitions are ambiguous. My interpretation is that Verheyen tried to use this in case a compound of cubes consists of subcompounds. A subcompound in its turn might consist of subcompounds, until you final end up with one cube. I also think that he needed to cover the conjunctive subcompounds with this.
        </p>
        <p>The part that is ambiguous is when a sum of components is used. These components are elements in a set and are themselves sets as well. It is unclear what he meant with the sum. I don't think that the Minkowski sum is meant here, neither did he mean to gather the components is a the set again, I think. It might be that he meant taking the union of these components, 
        </p>
        <p>Let's have a look at some example, though. Imagine a cube consisting of eight vertices v<sub>1</sub> to v<sub>8</sub>. You could describe the cube to consist of 6 faces, possibly as a result of an orbit of one square. Each square consists of 4 edges, which also might be the result of an orbit of one edge. The cube can then be described by the following space-(3) body:
        </p>
        <p>
          <div>{
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>}, {v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>}, {v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>}, {v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>}},
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>}, {v<sub>5</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>}, {v<sub>6</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>}, {v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>}},
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>}, {v<sub>6</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>}, {v<sub>7</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>}, {v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>}},
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>}, {v<sub>7</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>}, {v<sub>8</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>}, {v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>}},
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>}, {v<sub>8</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>}, {v<sub>5</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>}, {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>}},
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>5</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>}, {v<sub>6</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>}, {v<sub>7</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>}, {v<sub>8</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>}}
          </div>}
        </p>
        <p>This space-(3) body consists of six space-(2) bodies, which represent the faces. Assuming that Verheyen meant a union with 'the sum of these components' then this sum would lead to the following space-(2) body:
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{{v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>}, {v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>}, {v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>}, {v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>}, {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>}, {v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>}, {v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>}, {v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>}, {v<sub>5</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>}, {v<sub>6</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>}, {v<sub>7</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>}, {v<sub>8</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>}}
          </div>representing the twelve edges.
        </p>
        <p>At level one this sum would then contain all the vertices:
          <div style="margin-left: 10px;">{v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, v<sub>4</sub>, v<sub>5</sub>, v<sub>6</sub>, v<sub>7</sub>, v<sub>8</sub>}
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>Now according to Verheyen the set of these two bodies increased with the space-(3) body itself is called the space-(3) system. Here that would mean that the space-(3) system consists of the set of faces, the set of edges, and the set of vertices. The set of edges is an example of the level-(2) body in the system.

      <div id="conjunctive_vs_disjunctive">
        <p>On page 76 <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> makes a distinction between disjunctive and conjunctive suborbits. This leads to the disjunctive subcompounds from Chapter 5, section 1.1.1 and the discussion of conjunctive subcompounds section 1.1.2 in the same chapter.
        </p>
        <p>Press the button to see an example of a compound of eight tetrahedra with <button onclick="player.show('off/disjunctive_eg0.off', 'Disjunctive Subcompounds')">disjunctive</button> subcompounds of two tetrahedra, where the tetrahedra of the subcompounds share one vertex. Compare this with a compound of five tetrahedra with <button onclick="player.show('off/conjunctive_eg0.off', 'Conjunctive Subcompounds')">conjunctive</button> subcompounds of two tetrahedra, where two tetrahedra share a vertex as well. In the former it is possible to make distinct pairs of these subcompounds, and hence they can be giving their own colour, while in the latter it is impossible to make these distinct pairs. That is quite obvious, since the latter is a compound of five tetrahedra. What is happening is that each tetrahedron can form a subcompound with two other tetrahedra, leading to five pairs with overlapping tetrahedra.
        </p>
        <p>When you are looking for special angles for compounds with rotational freedon sometimes it is possible to find these distinct subcompounds and give them their own colour, and sometimes it isn't possbile to find distinct subcompounds. In that case constituents in one subcompound also occur in other subcompounds. Note that it is understood that in all of these cases of the subcompounds are supposed to have the same symmetry.
        </p>
        <p>Since constituents appear in two or more subcompounds it is sometimes hard to see whether it is actually possible to find some combination of constituents that form distinct subcompounds. <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> shows how this can be recognised by using group algebra.
        </p>
        <p>The <i>disjunctive</i> example above is a special angle for the compound 8 | S<sub>4</sub>A<sub>4</sub> / C<sub>3</sub> with rotational freedom. The subcompound is a 2 | D<sub>6</sub>C<sub>6</sub> / D<sub>3</sub>C<sub>3</sub>. <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> states that a subcompound is disjunctive if the subgroup, here C<sub>3</sub>, that the descriptive shares with the final symmetry, here S<sub>4</sub>A<sub>4</sub>, is also contained by the symmetry group of the subcompound. In the disjunctive example given here that is indeed the case: consider e.g. the blue subcompound: the 3-fold axis that each tetrahedron in the subcompound shares with the final compound is indeed also a 3-fold axis in the subcompound. As a matter of fact it is a 6-fold axis in the subcompound.
        </p>
        <p>The <i>conjunctive</i> example above is a special angle for the compound 5 | D<sub>5</sub>C<sub>5</sub> / C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>1</sub> with rotational freedom. As in the disjunctive example the conjunctive subcompound is a 2 | D<sub>3</sub>C<sub>3</sub> / C<sub>3</sub>. The subgroup C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>1</sub> consists of the identity 'E' and a reflection, while 2 | D<sub>3</sub>C<sub>3</sub> / C<sub>3</sub> consists of the rotations around a 3-fold axis and three reflections, with the reflection planes intersecting the 3-fold axis. One can see that those reflection planes are not the reflection planes that a tetrahedron shares with the final symmetry. In fact they aren't relection planes of any tetrahedron at all, since the subgroup C<sub>3</sub> of that subcompound only contains direct isometries. This is what makes this a conjunctive subcompound.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> also shows how to combine conjunctive subcompounds to obtain disjunctive subcompounds. In the conjunctive example above that will lead to the whole compound, which isn't very surprising since the compound consists of five tetrahedra, and the number five is a prime number.
        </p>
        <p>Consider instead <button onclick="player.show('off/conjunctive_eg1.off', 'Conjunctive Subcompounds')">this conjunctive</button> example. This is a special angle for 12 | S<sub>4</sub> / C<sub>2</sub> for which subcompounds 2 | C<sub>2</sub> / E get a higher stability 2 | D<sub>3</sub> / C<sub>3</sub> because the two tetrahedra in a subcompound share a 3-fold axis. The 3D model shows four of the subcompounds in colour and it isn't possible to find more of these pairs with the remaining four gray tetrahedra. As mentioned this is a typical property of a conjunctive subcompound. Note that the dark gray tetrahedron can be combined with any green one to form another pair.
        </p>
        <p>The symmetry of the conjunctive subcompounds, D<sub>3</sub>, contains the rotations around a 3-fold axis and three half-turns, which axes are perpendicular to the 3-fold axis. For the green subcompound you can find the 3-fold axis by pulling the green vertex located just before 12 o'clock to the centre of the image. A 2-fold axis can be found between the two green vertices at four o'clock (after reloading the 3D image e.g. by pressing the button again). This 2-fold axis isn't shared with a 2-fold axis of a tetrahedron, which means that the half-turn of the subgroup C<sub>2</sub> from in 12 | S<sub>4</sub> / C<sub>2</sub> isn't a subgroup of the symmetry  of the subcompound: D<sub>3</sub>. Note that D<sub>3</sub> does have a subgroup C<sub>2</sub>, but in this example the orientation is wrong.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> describes that you can find disjunctive subcompounds that consist of the conjunctive subcompounds by adding the subgroup of the whole compound and to the group of the subcompound and by closing the resulting set. In the example above that means that the half-turn from the subgroup C<sub>2</sub> in 12 | S<sub>4</sub> / C<sub>2</sub> should be added. One of of those can be found by reloading the 3D image and pulling the part at 9 o'clock between the blue and yellow vertices to the centre of the image. Then you will look straight into a 2-fold axis, i.e. an edge, of a green tetrahedron.
        </p>
        <p>If you apply this half-turn to the whole green subcompound, then the other green tetrahedron will be mapped onto the darker gray one. In other words this one needs to be added to the subcompound. Now one needs to make sure to do the same for the shared 2-fold axis of the other green tetrahedron and also for each added tetrahedron. With shared 2-fold axis is meant the 2-fold axis of the tetrahedron that is shared with the whole compound.
        </p>
        <p>In this example it is enough to only add that darker gray one to close the group. If you apply this same mehod to the other colours, you will get <button onclick="player.show('off/disjunctive_eg1.off', 'Disjunctive Subcompounds')">these disjunctive</button> subcompounds. They have the symmetry 3 | D<sub>3</sub> / C<sub>2</sub>. One of the 2-fold axis can be found at the same location as indicated before when the half-turn was applied and the dark gray tetrahedron was added. The 3-fold axis is shared with a 3-fold axis of the whole compound and for the green one you can find this by taking the point between 1 and 2 o'clock and pull it towards the centre, though not all the way.
        </p>
        <p>What is special for this subcompound compared to the other angles in the domain of rotatinal freedom, is that any pair of tetrahedra in the subcompound share a 3-fold axis.
