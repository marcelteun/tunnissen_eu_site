For several years I had been walking around with the idea for this
model, when I finally had enough time to develope it somewhere in the year 2000.
With help of an algebraic system it took me something like 3 months to calculate
the things I needed, and to write the documentation. Building took me 5
months...I should say 4 months, because I had a break of one month when
I was half way.

<P><b>
The whole model is a compound of 12 cubes with four colours. The model belongs
to the symmetry group that contains all the rotations of the tetrahedron and the
central inversion, indicated by Coxeter as A<sub>4</sub> x I. Each colour forms a
compound of 3 cubes. These compounds are the Classic Compounds of 3 cubes and
belong to the same symmetry group as the cube itself. It is a special position
of a compound of cubes that has spherical freedom and it is indicated by
A<sub>4</sub> x I / E x I, i.e. none of the cubes share a rotation axis or a
reflection plane. I guess there is a similar compound that consists of 3 Bakos'
compounds, but I don't know how to find it.

Another special property is that you'll get a Trapezoidal Icositretrahedron, which is the dual of a Rhombicubocatahedron, if you take one sort of pairs of parallel squares.

This model was destroyed by my kids in 2013, after I allowed them to play with
it. The model was too big and I didn't really like it. The pieces were used for
building other models later.
