      <h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>In the book <a href="#HVerh01">[HVER01]</a> Mr. Verheyen derives all possible groups of cube compounds. <a href="../cubes/index.html">This page</a> is based on his book. Later he wrote <a href="#HVerh02">[HVER02]</a> which holds the classication of compounds of all polyhedra. Unfortunately this book was never published. Nevertheless, this page is based on that book and it tries to summarise the compounds of tetrahedra. The special angles of the the compounds with rotational freedom aren't part of <a href="#HVerh02">[HVER02]</a> and are found and calculated by me.
      </p>
      <p>A rough description of a method to obtain a certain tetrahedron compound can be as follows: Choose one of the finite groups of isometries, define an orientation for this group and define a position of a tetrahedron (referred to as the descriptive). Then by using the operators of the isometry group on this tetrahedron, a compound of tetrahedra belonging to that group is obtained. When the tetrahedron shares symmetries with the final compound, then some of them can be skipped. The former is referred to as the stabiliser symmetry group and it is an algebraic subgroup of the final symmetry, hence the naming n | G / F, where n refers to the amount of tetrahedra, G is the symmetry group of the compound and F is the stabiliser symmetry.

      <p>This page and the models are generated by a Python program <a href="#MTun01">[MTUN01]</a>. They are displayed with help of a JavaScript bundle <a href="#MTun02">[MTUN02]</a>.
