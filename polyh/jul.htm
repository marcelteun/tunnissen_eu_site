Ok, the name doesn't say much. It's just a name, anyway. I didn't came up with this idea myself, but I built it for Xmas. My idea was to build an inverted sky (inside out) with 12 stars. It has a close relationship with the well-known compound of 5 cubes. It's rather easy to recognise the five cubes.

The only drawback of the model is that it's not such a rigid model. A close look learns that not all edges are straight. Ah well, I'm still satisfied with the result.
